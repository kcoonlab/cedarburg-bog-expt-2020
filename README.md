Files in this repository:

Cleaned Pitcher Field Code.Rmd --> executable/knitabble R markdown file to complete all analyses described in the associated manuscript, this file relies on several files also in this repo

all_field_entry.csv --> all raw field data collected as a .csv file

betta_test_df --> dataframe for hypothesis testing of diversity metrics by covariates of interest, generated using draft code in .rmd file, but provided here for ease of use

consensus taxa biotypeR genus.csv --> dataframe of taxa idenitifed as drivers of clusters in PAM analysis and identified as differentially abundant by cluster by aldex2

field diversity sample-wise --> intermediate object with all diversity estimations

final_pitcher_phyloseq --> phyloseq object used in all subsequent analysis

larvae_nutrients_respiration.csv --> .csv for covariate-by-larvae analysis presented in .rmd

metadata_pitch.csv --> .csv used for determining significance of larval colonization by treatment over time

temp_tax_table.csv --> taxonomy used for tests of richness differences within genera associated with a given biotype

with_biotype_genus_harvest --> late timepoint phyloseq object with samples annotated by biotype and glommed to the genus level
